    <p class="About-me">My name is <span style="border: 1px solid black">Jose Fonseca</span>, born in Honduras, raised in Kansas. From an early age I had a passion for technology. Wither it was tinkering with the electronics at home, or  playing video games till daybreak, I was always messing around with something technical. As I got into high school I grew an interest  in graphical design and was pretty certain that it was my dream job. However though one of my graphical design classes I gained an opportunity that would change my life forever. I was selected to be an apprentice at Cerner Corporation, and through my senior year in high school I worked around professionals in the computer science field, this opened my passion for computer science, and lead me to enroll at Rockhurst University for a computer science major.</p>
